The idea behind this modules is to simplify the ssh2 interface for sftp. This module has not OS dependencies so it can be run from Windows, Mac, and Linux.\n\n## Getting Started\nThis module depends on: `ssh2`  and `scp2`\n```bash\n\tnpm install sftp-upload\n```\n\nYou must configure the sftp before attempting to upload files. The following parameters are required in the sftp.config object.\n\n- **host:** Remote server IP/Hostname.\n- **port:** sftp port, 22 by default.\n- **username:** sftp server's username.\n- **path:** Location of the directory that is going to be uploaded to the server.\n- **remoteDir:** Remote directory where files are going to be uploaded.\n- **privateKey:** RSA key, you must upload a public key to the remote server before attempting to upload any content.\n\n### Example\n```js\n    var Sftp = require('sftp-upload'),\n        fs = require('fs');\n    \n    var options = {\n        host:'localhost',\n        username:'root',\n        path: '/',\n        remoteDir: '/tempDir',\n        privateKey: fs.readFileSync('privateKey_rsa')\n    },\n    sftp = new Sftp(options);\n    \n    sftp.on('error', function(err){\n        throw err;\n    })\n    .on('uploading', function(pgs){\n        console.log('Uploading', pgs.file);\n        console.log(pgs.percent+'% completed');\n    })\n    .on('completed', function(){\n        console.log('Upload Completed');\n    })\n    .upload();\n```\n\n### Events\n\n- connect\n- uploading ({file: currentFile, percent: percentage left})\n- error (err)\n- completed\n\n## License \n\n(The BSD License)\n\nCopyright (c) 2014 Carlos Martin &lt;pirumpi@gmail.comt&gt;\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining\na copy of this software and associated documentation files (the\n'Software'), to deal in the Software without restriction, including\nwithout limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,\ndistribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to\npermit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to\nthe following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be\nincluded in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED 'AS IS', WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\nEXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.\nIN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY\nCLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT,\nTORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE\nSOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.\n",
